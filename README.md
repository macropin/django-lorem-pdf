If you're looking for a simple example of PDF Generation in Python / Django then you might find this interesting.

If you have to ask why, then this project is not for you :)

* Requests to _http://localhost:8000/pdf/<xx>.pdf_ will generate a pdf with randomised lorem content.
* Requests to _http://localhost:8000/html/<xx>.html_ will generate html with randomised lorem content.

## Installation

To make use of this awesomely random project, first setup your Django project then add the following to your project urlpatterns (_urls.py_):

<pre>
    url(r'', include('docmk.urls')),
</pre>

And then add the following to your _INSTALLED_APPS_ in _settings.py_"

<pre>

You'll also need _adlibre-django_ for the PDF rendering code, and any other requirements:

</pre>
