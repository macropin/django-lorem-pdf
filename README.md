# Django Loremized PDF generator

If you're looking for a simple example of PDF Generation in Python / Django then you might find this interesting.

If you have to ask why, then this project is not for you :) 

## Usage

* Requests to _http://localhost:8000/pdf/<xx>.pdf_ will generate a pdf with randomised lorem content.
* Requests to _http://localhost:8000/html/<xx>.html_ will generate html with randomised lorem content.

## Installation

To make use of this awesomely random project, first setup your Django project then add the following to your project urlpatterns (_urls.py_):

<pre>
    url(r'', include('lorem_pdf.urls')),
</pre>

And then add the following to your _INSTALLED_APPS_ in _settings.py_"

<pre>
    'django.contrib.webdesign',
    'lorem_pdf',
</pre>

You'll also need _adlibre-django_ for the PDF rendering code. If you use pip to install this then the dependency and any other requirements will be taken care of:

<pre>
    pip install -e git+git://github.com/macropin/django-lorem-pdf.git#egg=django-lorem-pdf
</pre>
